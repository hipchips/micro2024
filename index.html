      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> 
	Fast-evolving artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as large language models have been driving
	the ever increasing computing demands in today’s data centers. Heterogeneous computing with domain-specific
	architectures (DSAs) brings many opportunities to boost compute horsepower via scaling up and scaling out
	the computing system. While accelerator architecture continues evolving to integrate more compute elements
	into a single chip, chiplet-based heterogeneous architecture is favored to keep scaling up and scaling out
	the system as well as to reduce the design complexity and cost stemming from the traditional monolithic chip design.      
	  </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> 
	However, how to interconnect computing resources and orchestrate heterogeneous chiplets is the key to success. 
	With the diversity and evolving demands of different AI workloads, chiplet architecture faces a few challenges:
	1) Lack of mature unified standards and tools to allow different pieces of silicon across vendors to integrate
	seamlessly through a common interface. 2) Composable architecture design to enable resource sharing and data
	coherency. 3) Extended reach of chiplet interconnect with high bandwidth and low latency, especially when
	the chip area gets close to the wafer scale. 4) Software programming model for heterogeneous parallelism on
	chip with optimal power and performance.
	  </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> 
	The 4th International workshop on the High Performance Chiplet and Interconnect Architectures (<strong>HiPChips-2024</strong>)
	aims to address these challenges and how they impact on the designs of chiplet-based architecture and software
	ecosystem. The major objective of this workshop is to bring together the latest research and development
	from academia and industry and foster closer collaboration to push the technologies forward. This workshop
	will focus on but not limited to the following topics:	      
	  <br>
	  Architecture:
	      <li> Heterogeneous chiplet architectures with emerging technologies (e.g., in-memory computing, optical computing, quantum computing, etc.) </li>
	      <li> Composable microarchitectures enabled by fast chiplet interconnect </li>
	      <li> Advancement of in-package communication, routing algorithm in SiP, and other related packaging technologies (testing, thermal, etc.) </li>
	      <li> Security of chiplet system </li>
	  Software and Ecosystem:
	      <li> Hardware software co-designs on chiplet architecture </li>
	      <li> Programming model, scheduling and optimizations of chiplet systems </li>
	      <li> Power, thermal, and sustainability studies for heterogeneous chiplet systems </li>
	      <li> Design space exploration (DSE) in chiplet systems </li>
